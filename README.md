# ProcessingOpenCV
Simple project in Processing to test OpenCV using a webcam to control variables.  
Initial code was based off a flocking simulation example by Stray Basilisk, found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM1sUYfk2Vw

As note, this is quite a good flocking sim in terms of optimization using a spatial grid.
