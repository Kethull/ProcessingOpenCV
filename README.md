# ProcessingOpenCV
Simple project in Processing to test OpenCV using a webcam to control variables.  
Initial code was based off a flocking simulation example by Stray Basilisk, found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM1sUYfk2Vw

As note, this is quite a decent flocking sim in terms of optimization using a spatial grid.
 
To run the sketch download Processing from https://processing.org and open the flock.pde file.

Ideas:
	maybe look at using the following examples to add something interesting: 
        frame differencing
        mirror effect 1
        motion detection
        combination of pixel difference and motion detection to move the obstacles.  or even better control seperaction strength. 
        face detection to control 1. speed based off distance (closer faster) 2. more faces detected changes seperation strength
        hand detection and controls
